  General Information

    jpcap is a set of Java classes which provide an interface and system 
    for network packet capture. A protocol library and tool for visualizing 
    network traffic is included. 

    jpcap hides the low-level details of network packet capture by 
    abstracting many network packet types and protocols into Java classes. 
    Internally, jpcap implements bindings to the libpcap system library 
    through JNI (the Java Native Interface). 

    jpcap utilizes libpcap, a widely deployed shared-library for capturing 
    user-level packets. libpcap must be installed on your system in order 
    to use jpcap.

    jpcap consists of a small shared-library which wraps libpcap plus a 
    collection of Java classes. The shared-library component provides event
    hooks, communication and data conversion between a running Java VM and 
    libpcap. The 'capture' package contains the core capture system.
    The 'net' package contains abstractions for many network packet types 
    and protocols. The 'simulator' package contains a network simulator.

  Passive Packet Capture vs. Active Packet Injection

    jpcap is passive capture mechanism. If you want to create and inject arbitrary packets into a network, check out the sister 
    project 'jpwrite' at http://www.sf.net/projects/jpwrite. Together, 
    jpcap and jpwrite are a powerful combination.


  Running the Samples

    If you have installed from RPM and are looking to run the capture tool,
    try /usr/bin/jpcap.

    If you installed from .gz, try ./jpcap.

    jpcap can also be run in 'simulator' mode. In this mode, a pseudo
    network interface randomly generates network traffic for capture.
    The simulator can be enabled in properties/tool.properties.
